Welcome to MathWiki
====================================

When I was working on my math homeworks at UW-Madison, I got tired of scrolling the textbooks back and forth to check the definitions or equations -- how inconvenient!
Then I thought that I need a personal wiki on mathematics, and I built this website.

**Why do I need a personal wiki on mathematics?**
There are `Wikipedia <https://www.wikipedia.org>`_ and `Wolfram MathWorld <http://mathworld.wolfram.com>`_ that I use a lot, but they are not about the textbooks that I used, also, they are not editable to me, and I need a personal wiki system to *organize*, *review*, and *search* what I have learnt in class.

**MathWiki** is the wiki that helps me learning mathematics.
The content is mainly abstracted from the textbooks that I used for my class and from the Internet resources, with my own editting and notation for the convenience of understanding.
The references for the content are listed in the end of each webpage.
It is very personal, specific about what I have learnt in my class.
Still, people working on mathematics can use this for their work since basic concepts are lists.

Mathwiki is powered by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ -- a Python documentation generator.
I use it as a wiki system since it has features:

* Auto generated links for each headings.
* `MathJax <https://www.mathjax.org/>`_ support.
* HTML generation with easy cross referencing and nice builtin themes.
* Editting with `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (a markup language that is lightweighted).

**You can start using this wiki by the "quick search" in the sidebar or by the TOC below.**

Thanks for reading. Enjoy!
