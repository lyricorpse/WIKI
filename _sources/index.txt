Welcome to MathWiki
====================================

When I was working on my PhD math homeworks, I got tired of scrolling the textbook back and forth to check the definitions or equations -- how inconvenient!
Then I thought that I need a personal wiki on mathematics.
**Why do I need a personal wiki on mathematics?**
There are Wikipeida and Wolfram MathWorld that I used a lot, but they are not about the textbooks that I used, also, they are not editable to me, and I need a personal wiki system to review what I have learnt in my class.

**MathWiki** is the wiki that helps me learning mathematics.
It is very personal, specific about what I have learnt in my class.
Still, people working on mathematics can use this for their work since basic concepts are lists.

You can start by the "quick search" in sidebar or by the TOC below.
Enjoy!
