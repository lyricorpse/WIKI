The Best Practice in Writing Mathematical Proofs
------------------------------------------------
In this section, I am tring to organize the "best practice" in writing mathematical proofs.
(Sadly, I got a 60/100 in the first mid-term exam of MATH 521, Spring 2016.
It is not that I did not know how to prove those theorems, it is just that I am not good at writing mathematical proofs in a time-limited environment and failed to organize my proofs well and suffered "time panic" in the exam.
So I had the idea of writing this section.)
The motivation is that I want my proofs to be clear-structured and easy to follow so that I can prove the theorems smoothly and get good scores in the exams.

We will prove several theorems to get the idea.

Proof (:math:`\bar{E}` is a :ref:`closed set <closed-set>`.):
*************************************************************

``Step 1. Explain the theorem as a logical statement as "if {conditions}, then {results}."``

:math:`\bar{E}` is a :ref:`closed set <closed-set>`. :math:`\iff` :math:`\bar{E}` contains all its :ref:`limit points <limit-point>`. :math:`\iff` If :math:`p` is a :ref:`limit point <limit-point>` of :math:`\bar{E}`, then :math:`p \in \bar{E}`.

**Remark**: I think that a main kind of failure of proving theorems is the confusion with {conditions} and {results} -- we need to be clear about *what we can use* and *what we want to get* all the time, so we should first separate the theorem as those two parts, and explain them in the language of logic so that we can manipulate them.
Also, we may use the definitions of the keywords in the theorem, so make sure to be familiar with them.


``Step 2. Explain the idea of the proof: suppose the {conditions} are true, show that the {results} are true.``

Suppose :math:`p` is a :ref:`limit point <limit-point>` of :math:`\bar{E}`, we will show that :math:`p \in \bar{E}`, i.e., :math:`p \in E` or :math:`p\in E'`.

``Step 3. Execute the idea of the proof: consider the {conditions} as given facts, and get the {results} from these given facts.``

Since :math:`p` is a :ref:`limit point <limit-point>` of :math:`\bar{E}`, by definition, we have

.. math::
    \forall r>0, \exists q \in \bar{E}, \text{ such that } d(p,q)<r.
    :label: def-limit-point

Since :math:`q\in \bar{E}`, then :math:`q \in E` or :math:`q\in E'`.

* If :math:`q\in E`, then, by modifiying :eq:`def-limit-point`, we have

.. math::
    \forall r>0, \exists q \in E, \text{ such that } d(p,q)<r,

which implies that :math:`p` is a limit point of :math:`E`, i.e., :math:`p\in E'`.

* If :math:`q\in E'`, then, by modifiying :eq:`def-limit-point` we have

.. math::
    \forall r'>0, \exists q \in E', \text{ such that } d(p,q)<r',

**Remark**: :math:`p` is infinitely close to a point :math:`q` which is in :math:`E'`.

Also, :math:`q\in E'` means that :math:`q` is a limit point of :math:`E`, i.e.,

.. math::
    \forall r_1>0, \exists q_1 \in E, \text{ such that } d(q,q_1)<r_1,

**Remark**: :math:`q` is infinitely close to a point :math:`q_1` which is in :math:`E`.

By the property of a :ref:`metric space <metric-space>`, we have

.. math::
    d(p,q_1) \le d(p,q) + d(q,q_1) < r'+r_2.

Denote :math:`r = r' + r_2 > 0`, then we have

.. math::
    \forall r>0, \exists q_1 \in E, \text{ such that } d(p,q_1)<r,

which implies that :math:`p` is a limit point of :math:`E`, i.e., :math:`p\in E'`.

**Remark**:
Since that
":math:`p` is infinitely close to a point :math:`q \in E'`"
and that
":math:`q` is infinitely close to a point :math:`q_1 \in E`,"
we get
:math:`p` is infinitely close to a point :math:`q_1 \in E`.

Q.E.D.

Proof (Every :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>` is an :ref:`open set <open-set>`.):
***********************************************************************************

``Step 1. If {conditions}, then {results}.``

Every :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>` is an :ref:`open set <open-set>`.
:math:`\iff`
Every point in the :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>` is an :ref:`interior point <interior-point>` of this neighborhood.
:math:`\iff`
If a point :math:`q` is in an arbitrary :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>` :math:`N_r(p)`, then :math:`q` is an :ref:`interior point <interior-point>` of :math:`N_r(p)`.

``Step 2. Explain the idea: suppose the {conditions} are true, show that the {results} are true.``

Suppose a point :math:`q\in N_r(p)`, :math:`N_r(p)` is an arbitrary :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>` with center :math:`p` and radius :math:`r`, we will show that :math:`q` is an :ref:`interior point <interior-point>` of :math:`N_r(p)`, meanning that

.. math::
    & \exists r_q>0, \text{ such that } N_{r_q}(q) \subset N_r(p). \\
    \iff &\exists r_q>0, \text{ such that }  \forall y\in N_{r_q}(q), y\in N_r(p). \\
    \iff &\exists r_q>0, \text{ such that }  \forall y, \text{ if } d(q,y)< r_q, \text{ then } d(p,y) < r.

``Step 3. Consider the {conditions} as given facts, and get the {results} from these given facts.``

Since :math:`q\in N_r(p)`, we have :math:`d(p,q)<r`.
:math:`\forall y`, if :math:`d(q,y) < r_q`, then by the property of a :ref:`metric space <metric-space>`, we have :math:`d(p,y) \le d(p,q) + d(q,y) < d(p,q) + r_q`.
We can take :math:`r_q>0` such that :math:`r_q < r - d(p,q)`, then :math:`d(p,y) < r`.
Hence such :math:`r_q` exists.

Q.E.D.

**Remark**:
To prove this theorem, we need to be familiar with the definitions of :ref:`neighborhood <neighborhood>`, :ref:`open set <open-set>`, and  :ref:`interior point <interior-point>`.
Notice that in Step 1, we were still using the definitions, while in Step 2,
the statement had been totally transformed into logical forms and mathematical expressions, which we can manipulate with only logic and math.
After Step 2, we don't need the knowledge of the definitions anymore!
Thus, in Step 3, we manipulated the transformed logical forms and mathematical expressions with logic and math, showing that they do hold.
